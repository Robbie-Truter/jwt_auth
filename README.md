## About this project:
In this project, I'm using MERN stack and Json Web Token (JWT for short) for user authentication.

There are 4 main roles:
- default
- management
- admin

- default users can find and add data to MongoDB.
- management users can find, add and update data in MongoDB.
- admin users can find find, add, update and delete data in MongoDB.

You can only register as a default user

To get access to admin or management privileges , view project homepage for more information.

I'm using React-Router to render different React components.
